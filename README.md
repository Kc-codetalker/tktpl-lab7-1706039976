# Hello World Android App with Flutter
This is a simple app written using Flutter which mimics my other native app from [my first Mobile Programming Course Lab session](https://github.com/Kc-codetalker/learn-tktpl-1706039976). It has TextField, RaisedButton, and Text widgets. The TextField (and "Enter" RaisedButton) add a functionality to change "World" in the "Hello, World!" Text into whatever entered into the field.

## Installation
There is currently no APK file in this commit. One will have to clone this repository and run it locally (using Android Studio or other tool).
